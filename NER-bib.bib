	abstract = {In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares ({OLS}) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix ({HCCM}), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a {HCCM} appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as {HC}0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that {HC}0 often results in incorrect inferences when N ≤ 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the {HCCM}, and especially a version known as {HC}3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a {HCCM} whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use {HCCM}-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N ≤ 250, the {HCCM} known as {HC}3 should be used. Since {HC}3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.},

	abstract = {Breusch and Pagan (1979) have recently proposed a convenient test for heteroscedasticity in general linear models. This note derives the asymptotic distribution of their test under sequences of contiguous alternatives to the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity. The test is shown to possess asymptotically incorrect size (nominal significance level) except in the case of strictly Gaussian disturbances. A slight modification of the test is proposed which corrects this defect.},
