	abstract = {The core methods in today's econometric toolkit are linear regression for statistical control, instrumental variables methods for the analysis of natural experiments, and differences-in-differences methods that exploit policy changes. In the modern experimentalist paradigm, these techniques address clear causal questions such as: Do smaller classes increase learning? Should wife batterers be arrested? How much does education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to speak.  In addition to econometric essentials, Mostly Harmless Econometrics covers important new extensions--regression-discontinuity designs and quantile regression--as well as how to get standard errors right. Joshua Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke explain why fancier econometric techniques are typically unnecessary and even dangerous. The applied econometric methods emphasized in this book are easy to use and relevant for many areas of contemporary social science.  An irreverent review of econometric essentials  A focus on tools that applied researchers use most  Chapters on regression-discontinuity designs, quantile regression, and standard errors  Many empirical examples  A clear and concise resource with wide applications},

	shorttitle = {Undergraduate Econometrics Instruction},
	abstract = {The past half-century has seen economic research become increasingly empirical, while the nature of empirical economic research has also changed. In the 1960s and 1970s, an empirical economist's typical mission was to "explain" economic variables like wages or {GDP} growth. Applied econometrics has since evolved to prioritize the estimation of specific causal effects and empirical policy analysis over general models of outcome determination. Yet econometric instruction remains mostly abstract, focusing on the search for "true models" and technical concerns associated with classical regression assumptions. Questions of research design and causality still take a back seat in the classroom, in spite of having risen to the top of the modern empirical agenda. This essay traces the divergent development of econometric teaching and empirical practice, arguing for a pedagogical paradigm shift.},

	abstract = {In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares ({OLS}) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix ({HCCM}), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a {HCCM} appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as {HC}0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that {HC}0 often results in incorrect inferences when N ≤ 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the {HCCM}, and especially a version known as {HC}3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a {HCCM} whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use {HCCM}-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N ≤ 250, the {HCCM} known as {HC}3 should be used. Since {HC}3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.},

This note derives the asymptotic distribution of their test under sequences of contiguous alternatives to the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity. The test is shown to possess asymptotically incorrect size (nominal significance level) except in the case of strictly Gaussian disturbances. A slight modification of the test is proposed which corrects this defect.},
