	abstract = {The core methods in today's econometric toolkit are linear regression for statistical control, instrumental variables methods for the analysis of natural experiments, and differences-in-differences methods that exploit policy changes. In the modern experimentalist paradigm, these techniques address clear causal questions such as: Do smaller classes increase learning? Should wife batterers be arrested? How much does education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to speak.  In addition to econometric essentials, Mostly Harmless Econometrics covers important new extensions--regression-discontinuity designs and quantile regression--as well as how to get standard errors right. Joshua Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke explain why fancier econometric techniques are typically unnecessary and even dangerous. The applied econometric methods emphasized in this book are easy to use and relevant for many areas of contemporary social science.  An irreverent review of econometric essentials  A focus on tools that applied researchers use most  Chapters on regression-discontinuity designs, quantile regression, and standard errors  Many empirical examples  A clear and concise resource with wide applications},

	abstract = {The past half-century has seen economic research become increasingly empirical, while the nature of empirical economic research has also changed. In the 1960s and 1970s, an empirical economist's typical mission was to "explain" economic variables like wages or {GDP} growth. Applied econometrics has since evolved to prioritize the estimation of specific causal effects and empirical policy analysis over general models of outcome determination. Yet econometric instruction remains mostly abstract, focusing on the search for "true models" and technical concerns associated with classical regression assumptions. Questions of research design and causality still take a back seat in the classroom, in spite of having risen to the top of the modern empirical agenda. This essay traces the divergent development of econometric teaching and empirical practice, arguing for a pedagogical paradigm shift.},

	abstract = {In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares ({OLS}) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix ({HCCM}), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a {HCCM} appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as {HC}0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that {HC}0 often results in incorrect inferences when N ≤ 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the {HCCM}, and especially a version known as {HC}3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a {HCCM} whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use {HCCM}-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N ≤ 250, the {HCCM} known as {HC}3 should be used. Since {HC}3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.},

	isbn = {978-0-674-40341-3},
	shorttitle = {The History of Statistics},
	abstract = {This magnificent book is the first comprehensive history of statistics from its beginnings around 1700 to its emergence as a distinct and mature discipline around 1900. Stephen M. Stigler shows how statistics arose from the interplay of mathematical concepts and the needs of several applied sciences including astronomy, geodesy, experimental psychology, genetics, and sociology. He addresses many intriguing questions: How did scientists learn to combine measurements made under different conditions? And how were they led to use probability theory to measure the accuracy of the result? Why were statistical methods used successfully in astronomy long before they began to play a significant role in the social sciences? How could the introduction of least squares predate the discovery of regression by more than eighty years? On what grounds can the major works of men such as Bernoulli, De Moivre, Bayes, Quetelet, and Lexis be considered partial failures, while those of Laplace, Galton, Edgeworth, Pearson, and Yule are counted as successes? How did Galton's probability machine (the quincunx) provide him with the key to the major advance of the last half of the nineteenth century? Stigler's emphasis is upon how, when, and where the methods of probability theory were developed for measuring uncertainty in experimental and observational science, for reducing uncertainty, and as a conceptual framework for quantitative studies in the social sciences. He describes with care the scientific context in which the different methods evolved and identifies the problems (conceptual or mathematical) that retarded the growth of mathematical statistics and the conceptual developments that permitted major breakthroughs. Statisticians, historians of science, and social and behavioral scientists will gain from this book a deeper understanding of the use of statistical methods and a better grasp of the promise and limitations of such techniques. The product of ten years of research, The History of Statistics will appeal to all who are interested in the humanistic study of science.},
